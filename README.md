# Do I Get the Privacy I Need? Benchmarking Utility in Differential Privacy Libraries


## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the paper.

We are evaluating five Differential Privacy Libraries for:
1) Synthetic Datasets
2) Real Datasets

### Differential Privacy Libraries are as follows:

1: (Python) IBM-diffprivlib. https://github.com/IBM/differential-privacy-library
2: (Python) OpenMined-PyDp. https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP
3: (Python) OpenDP-SmartNoise. https://github.com/opendp/smartnoise-core
4: (R) diffpriv. https://github.com/brubinstein/diffpriv
5: (Scala) Chorus. https://github.com/uvm-plaid/chorus

## Folders in Repository

### Datasets

1) Normally distributed datasets
2) Real Datasets

### Bugs

1) Whitenoise (v 1.0.3)
2) diffpriv_count_query (sensitivity sampler)

### Libraries_Benchmark

1) Normally_distributed_dataset_experiments
2) Real_dataset_experiments

### Time_and_Memory_calculation

Contain code to calculate `Execution Time` and `Memory Consumed`.


To run the code kindly read the `README.md` file in all sub-folders.
