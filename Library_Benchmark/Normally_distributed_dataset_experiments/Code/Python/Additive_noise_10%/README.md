# Benchmarking Differential Privacy Libraries

## How to run it:



## Benchmarked libraries:

1. IBM-diffprivlib
2. OpenDP-Smartnoise
3. Openmined-PyDP
4. diffpriv-R
5. TensorFlow DP
6. MIT-PrivateMultiWeight
7. CHORUS DP
8. GUPT
9. PINQ

Each folder contains a executable to perform basic queries.

We compare them on the basis of there purpose, composition and efficiency.
First we evaluate them for single queries on Normal distributions then we used them for our real world use-case (Eco-Friendly Driving).
